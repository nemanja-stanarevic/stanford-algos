##My solutions for Stanford/Coursera class on design and analysis of algorithms

Implemented in Scala

* part1-assignment1: Counting inversions by merge-sorting a large set
* part1-assignment2: Counting number of comparisons in QuickSort partition function with various pivots (first, last, median)
* part1-assignment3: Finding min cuts in a graph using randomized contraction algorithm
* part1-assignment4: Computing strongly connected components of a large directed graph using Kosaraju. Optimized DFS portion of Kosaraju to tail recursive, so it keeps its stack together
* part1-assignment5: Simple implementation of Dijkstra (without heap)
